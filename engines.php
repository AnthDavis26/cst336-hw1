					<div id="article_title">UNREAL ENGINE</div>
					<p>With advanced physics, visuals, and a streamlined Blueprints feature as of Unreal Engine 4, 
					   it is no surprise that Unreal Engine is often used for high-presentation video games. Behind 
					   the scenes, Epic Games' Unreal Engine utilizes  
					   <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Introduction/index.html">C++.</a></p>

					<div id="article_title2">UNITY</div>
					<p>Unlike the languages described on this site, Unity relies on C#. Adapting to C# is fairly 
					   simple for Java and C++ developers. Unity provides fantastic results for game projects and 
					   is arguably easier to use than Unreal. The features are somewhat limited compared to Unreal, 
					   but add-ons can be installed from the Unity store.</p>

					<div id="article_title3">GameMaker Studio</div>
					<p>Those who are not inclined to program may find Game Maker to their liking. Its features are 
					   not as deep and thorough as those in Unreal and Unity, but it is very simple to use for smaller  
					   projects.<br /><br />
					   Although GameMaker has a free version, this version is even more restricted.</p><br/><br/>
