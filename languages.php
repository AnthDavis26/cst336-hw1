					<div id="article_title">C/C++ LANGUAGE</div>
					<p>Generally speaking, modern-day games are programmed on the back of C++, basically the 
					   evolution of the C language. With the extensive support of software that utilize the speed 
					   of C++, it is the backbone of major game engines such as 
					   <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Introduction/index.html">Unreal Engine.</a></p>

					<div id="article_title">ASSEMBLY</div>
					<p>Prior to C++ becoming standard for game programming, assembly language was used due to
					   limited hardware capabilities on home consoles. While assembly languages (which vary 
					   depending on the processor used) are a step closer to machine language, they can grow 
					   complicated for large projects. Hardware is faster and more capable now, leaving assembly 
					   language more useful for less-capable hardware or occasional inline programming in C.<br/><br/>
					   Games like <a href="http://www.chrissawyergames.com/faq3.htm">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> are a 
					   testament to just how optimized assembly scripts can be.</p>

					<div id="article_title">JAVA</div>
					<p>Unlike C/C++ and assembly language, Java focuses on clear programming and compatibility 
					   with as many hardware devices and operating systems as possible. Due to the implementation 
					   of Java's Virtual Machine, along with behind-the-scenes management of unneeded memory, it 
					   does not necessarily work fast enough for large-scale games.<br/><br/>Possibly the most well-known 
					   game to be developed with Java is <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/">Minecraft</a> 
					   (although it has since been branched and ported to C++ for 
					   <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/minecraft-for-windows-10/9nblggh2jhxj?activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab">Microsoft platforms</a> 
					   to increase performance while maintaining cross-platform online multiplayer).</p>
